<p> i used an ai painter software called "gaugan 2", where you draw on a blank template and the AI converts it into a realistic image. Then, i added stuff into it through photoshop.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I used the house brush, the water brush, the grass brush,&nbsp; and the wood brush to make this, and added Slim Shady aka Eminem to the picture.</p>

<p>I used the stone brush and the cloud brush to make this, and added some brush strokes to the picture.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
